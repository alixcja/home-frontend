# EXP Home Frontend
Here is the frontend for EXP Home, which has been completely reengineered in Vue 3.

EXP Home was an internal company website for booking various gaming consoles, console accessories, and games. It also includes a dashboard with all the latest news and important information.

In the future, a restaurant list will be added to make choosing lunch options easier. Additionally, there will be a group order feature and a voting system to decide what to eat for lunch.

You can find the corresponding backend [here](https://github.com/alixcja/home-backend).

Here is an example of the booking functionality:
